## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 4th-semester student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, maintaining a 4.0/4.0 GPA. I originally studied mechanical engineering, but now Iâ€™m focused on **backend and database development**.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, C#, Java, React, React Native, Oracle, Svelte, JavaScript  
- **Additional Tools**: Comfortable using JIRA for project management  
- **Interests**: Building IoT projects (currently developing a self-driving car using Arduino) and 3D printing  
- **Certifications**: AWS Cloud Practitioner  
- **Strengths**: Attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and a love for hands-on technology challenges  

Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies and collaborate on innovative projects. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanish-jierdh-91820a60/).
